# JokingApp
# Key Features

1. Fetch Jokes Button

A prominent "TELL ME A JOKE" button enables users to retrieve a random joke.
The button is styled with:
A custom font size of 30.
A background color defined in the app's asset catalog.
Rounded corners with a border for a polished look.

2. Joke Display Area

The jokes are displayed dynamically in a central area on the app screen.
The joke text is separated into two parts:
Question (e.g., "Why did the Clydesdale give the pony a glass of water?")
Punchline (e.g., "Because he was a little horse.")

3. Interactive Design

The layout ensures the button and joke text are placed close together for a cohesive and compact design.
The background and color themes are customizable, enhancing the visual appeal.

4. Voice Integration (Text-to-Speech)

The app includes a Text-to-Speech feature that reads the joke aloud for users.

When a joke is fetched, the punchline is automatically spoken using AVSpeechSynthesizer, making the experience more interactive.
The voice can be customized in terms of language, rate, and tone for an engaging user experience.


# How to Use the Application
